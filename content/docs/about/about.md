## VFRAME researches and develops state-of-the-art computer vision technologies for human rights research and conflict zone monitoring


VFRAME is developed and maintained by [Adam Harvey](https://adam.harvey.studio) in Berlin with contributions from Jules LaPlace, Josh Evans, and a growing list of collaborators. VFRAME is being piloted with [Mnemonic.org](Mnemonic.org) an organization dedicated to helping human rights defenders effectively use digital documentation of human rights violations and international crimes to support advocacy, justice and accountability. 

VFRAME's command line interface (CLI) image processing software and detection models are open-source with MIT licenses and available at [github.com/vframeio](https://github.com/vframeio).

### Origins and Mission

The idea for VFRAME grew out of discussions at a 2017 Data Investigation Camp organized by [Tactical Technology Collective](https://tacticaltech.org/) in Montenegro. Through meeting with investigative journalists, human rights researchers, and digital activists from around the world it became clear that computer vision was a much needed tool in this community yet the solutions were nowhere in sight.

Since then VFRAME's mission has been to research, prototype, and deploy computer visions systems that accelerate the capabilities of human rights researchers and investigative journalists.

More precisely, the VFRAME project develops two main technologies: a core image processing engine to analyze large collections of videos (millions) or images (billions), and a synthetic data rendering system to generate high-fidelity training data. Together, these two approaches are being utilized to develop accurate object detectors capable of locating objects of interest (e.g. an RBK-250 tailfin or a 9N235 submunition) in millions of video files culled from online sources. 

Stay tuned for more updates during 2023 including the release of the RBK-250, RBK-500, Uragan, Smerch, and AO-25RT submunition.
