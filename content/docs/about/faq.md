## FAQ

**Which computer vision frameworks do you use?**

VFRAME is built with Python and currently uses the Darknet framework for training DNNs for object detection, the OpenCV DNN module for inference, and a modular CLI interface designed with Click to run the scripts.

VFRAME is built with extensibility in mind to adapt to the dynamic needs of small human rights reserach groups. New modules can be added for special tasks.

**Where do you receive funding?**

VFRAME has been awarded two grants from the [PrototypeFund](https://prototypefund.de) ([BMBF](https://www.bmbf.de)) in Germany.

**Who works on VFRAME?**

VFRAME is developed by [Adam Harvey](https://ahprojects.com) and contributors in Berlin.

3D models are developed by [30000FPS](http://30000fps.com)


**I work for a newsroom. Can we use VFRAME?**

The VFRAME tools are be published on GitHub and licensed under the MIT License. However, the tools are designed mostly for small teams working on human rights related research. We cannot provide tech support at this time.


**Can I contribute?**

Berlin-based volunteers are currently needed for a summer 2019 project to build a visual index of objects of interest in Syria in Yemen, including mostly munitions. No previous experience necessary. Research and organizational skills are a must. The guide will be published towards the end of the year and also be used to build object detection profiles.
