Through a grant, NESTA supported VFRAME's research into synthetic datasets in 2019-2020 as well as continued development of the VFRAME search engine.  Through this grant, we were able to make better 3D models and enhance our synthetic data generation process, producing more realistic imagery which in turn trains more accurate models.
