# Uragan 220MM 9M27 Rocket Detector

Building computer vision algorithms with 3D modeling to detect the Uragan 220MM 9M27 rocket

![Uragan tail photogrammetry reconstruction paths. &copy; Adam Harvey / VFRAME.io and Tech 4 Tracing. 2023](/docs/detectors/uragan/vframe-uragan-01.jpg)

This is a preliminary post on building an object detection algorithm for the Uragan 220MM 9M27 rocket tailfin widely documented in videos from the war in Ukraine. This is a joint research project developed in collaboration with Tech 4 Tracing.


Detection model under development. Page will be updated as more information is available. Estimated timeline:

Notes and disclaimers:
- **NEVER HANDLE OR APPROACH ANY MUNITION WITHOUT EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE (EOD) TRAINING OR SUPERVISION FROM EOD PERSONNEL.**
- Documentation and benchmark photos with FFE (real) ordnance are carried out in restricted areas where the object never leaves the premise.
- Documentation and benchmark photos with (fake) replicas are carried out in controlled areas with no other persons nearby.
