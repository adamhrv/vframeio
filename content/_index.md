### About VFRAME

Human rights researchers often rely on videos shared online to document war crimes, atrocities, and human rights violations. Manually reviewing these videos is expensive, does not scale, and can cause vicarious trauma. As an increasing number of videos are posted, a new approach is needed to understand these large datasets.

Since 2017 VFRAME has been working with [Mnemonic.org](http://mnemonic.org), a Berlin-based organization dedicated to documenting war crimes and human rights violations, to develop computer vision tools to address these challenges.

Specifically, VFRAME has been developing a scalable computer vision system for large-scale analysis of video archives to detect illegal munitions, and redaction tools to blur faces. VFRAME can detect objects, such as the [RBK-250](/rbk250/) munition found in videos from the Syrian conflict or the [9N235](/9n235/) submunition documented in Ukraine, with up to 99% accuracy at over 400 FPS on a single workstation. The vocabulary of objects is growing and will soon include the [AO-2.5RT](/ao25rt), Uragan/Smerch rockets, and the RBK-500.


### Core Technologies

VFRAME creates high-fidelity synthetic data to develop custom object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification technologies for high-risk objects including cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines. Read about our past and current research in the press:
